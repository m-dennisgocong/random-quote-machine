## Project Summary

This project is for [Front End Development Libraries 5 Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/). This is part of freeCodeCamp course. In this challenge I will learn to use some of the most popular libraries.
        
## Feature Overview

* Use API Quotes 
* On first load display a random quote and quote's author
* A "twitter button" that share the current quote  
* A "random button" that fetch the new random quotes   

## Implementation and Goal 

For this project, I mainly use React library and created a simple UI yet user friendly while
implementing logic in the most concise way possible. The React course on freeCodeCamp mainly focus on using Class Components but I used Functional Component with React Hooks however Hook it's not within freeCodeCamp course perview I have to learn on my own and do my own research. The reason I implement using React Hooks is that the majority now uses React Hooks because it's easy and fast to implement.
