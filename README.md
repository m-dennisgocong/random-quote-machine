## General Info

This is one of my project for [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/) on freeCodeCamp course. The purpose of this challenge is to apply what we learn, to test out and showcase front end skills.

## Problems Encountered 

For this project, I mainly use React library using React Hooks however The React course on freeCodeCamp mainly focus on using Class Components which it's not within freeCodeCamp course preview so basically I have to do my own thing, learning from documentation and watching a lot of youtube tutorial. 

Learning how to use Class Component first from freeCodeCamp made me appreciate React Hooks. The reason I implement Hooks because it's easy and fast to implement.
