## General Info

This is one of my project for [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/) on freeCodeCamp course. The purpose of this challenge is to apply what we learn, to test out and showcase front end skills.
        
## Problems Encountered 

For this project, I mainly use React library using React Hooks however The React course on freeCodeCamp mainly focus on using Class Components which it's not within freeCodeCamp course preview so basically I have to do my own thing, learning from documenation and watching a lot of tutorial from youtube. 

The reason I implement using React Hooks because it's easy and fast to implement. It was an easy transition learning React Hooks since freeCodeCamp course is focus mainly on Class Component it made me appreciate React Hooks.
